\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Part A}
\\
In part A, we write three simple assembly programs to mimic three functions in example.c. 
Based on ensuring correctness，we especially focus on the functional equivalence with the example C functions. 
By selecting and placing labels in the assembly code appropriately, the code is also very readable.\\
\textbf{Part B}
\\
In part B, we modify the HCL file of the SEQ to add a new instruction --- iaddl. 
The following is the roadmap to finish this part:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Clarify the computation process of iadd and write it down at the beginning in seq-full.hcl.
        \item Add any dependence relations of iaddl to all boosigs.
        \item Design the datapath for iaddl (generate control signals for src and dst)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Part C}
\\
We achieve full scores in the benchmark testing in just 2 hours, 
but we spent 2 more days researching all the potential methods to optimize the performance even further. 
The following is our roadmap:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Change the order of the instruction sequence to avoid data hazard and structure hazards, which leaves $CPI \approx 12$.
        \item Beyond the changes on instructions order, we use loop unrolling to reduce the number of conditional check and registers updating.
        \item Use a binary search tree to find the precise remaining number of loops after several rounds of unrolling to achieve complete unrolling, which leaves $CPI \approx 8.95$
        \item 
\end{itemize}
